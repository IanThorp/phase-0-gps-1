##What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I actually feel pretty confident with the git concepts and commands. I typically was using git pull rather than git fetch and git merge because I've been working alone, so to use that in today's session was good practice just to solidify I understand it.

##What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
The concepts we discussed throughout this GPS was:
- Creating a repository
- Cloning a repository to your local machine
- Working in a feature branch and why it's important in collaboration and workflow
- Making pull requests, reviewing them, and merging them in a collaborative way
- Using git commands such as git fetch and git merge to make sure the local machine is updated
- Merge Conflicts and how to view and resolve them

##What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I remember asking to clarify between git pull and git fetch/git merge, which I already had an idea of the differences. Questions came up here and there about working on the master branch and merge conflicts. Otherwise, my pair and I were confident in the tasks.

##What still confuses you about git?
To be honest, I think I would need to encounter the issue to know what confuses me. Up to date, I feel I fully grasp git and how to use it.

##How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
I thought it went really well. My pair and I seemed to be on the same level of competency and the guide really only stepped in to enhance the experience for us. I didn't feel like anything was complicated to the point of confusion, more to the point of validation if anything. I'm looking forward to doing more Guided Pairing Sessions!

1. What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
Before this session, I had no idea what to do when conflicts emerged, nor how they would in most cases. Going through a simple small conflict helped me figure out exactly what to do when it happens.

2. What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
The concepts of solving conflicts as well as what exactly is going on when one uses git fetch and git merge.

3. What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I asked what the difference was between git fetch/merge and git pull.

4. What still confuses you about git?
I feel like I am pretty solid on git. It all makes sense to me as of now.

5. How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
It was a pretty good expierence. I feel both of us had a good idea what we were doing and why certain commands went where. I look forward to my next GPS expierence.
